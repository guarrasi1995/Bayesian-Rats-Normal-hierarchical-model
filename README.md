# Bayesian-Rats-Normal-hierarchical-model
Propose an in-depth fully Bayesian analysis (using MCMC simulation) of some real data taken either from literature data or from other (possibly public) sources. Choose an appropriate statistical model to deal with the data.
1. explain the overall features of the statistical model such as the role of the parameters and the inferential goals of the analysis
2. check the ability of a fully Bayesian analysis to recover model parameters with data simulated from the model
3. illustration of the dataset
4. illustration of the features of the MCMC output
5. illustration of the Bayesian estimation of parameters as well as possible hypothesis testing
6. discussion on the ability of the estimated model to recover some features of the observed data
7. comparative analysis with frequentist inference
8. model comparison through DIC and/or marginal likelihood
9. formal use of model checking diagnostics
